For the tutorial
Hi, my name is Luke. I work as an Operations Analyst and write SQL and VBA for my job. I studied economics and business intelligence in college, and did an economic research internship. In the course of those studies I learned a smattering of mySql, SAS, R, Python, and JavaScript but mostly basics. I am now learning R for a Coursera course on data science with hopes of teachiong myself the basics of machine learning.
